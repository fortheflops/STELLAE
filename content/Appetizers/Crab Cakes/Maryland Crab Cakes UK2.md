### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Cracker Crumbs:** Roll out crackers into fine crumbs. Place the crumbs on a plate or shallow dish.
2. **Combine Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, gently combine the crab meat, eggs, mayonnaise, horseradish, parsley, Tabasco sauce, salt, and pepper. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the crab cakes tough.
3. **Form the Crab Cakes:** Shape the crab mixture into cakes. The size is up to you, but they are typically about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and 2-3 inches in diameter.
4. **Coat with Crumbs:** Gently pat each crab cake into the cracker crumbs, coating both sides lightly.
5. **Fry the Crab Cakes:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough oil (vegetable, canola, or another high-heat oil) or butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Once hot, carefully place the crab cakes in the skillet, leaving some space between them.
6. **Cook:** Fry for about 3-5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and heated through. The internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C).
7. **Drain and Serve:** Remove the crab cakes from the skillet and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately.
