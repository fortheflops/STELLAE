I've always been fascinated by how food reflects the past. Not just what people ate, but how they got it, prepared it, and shared it. It tells a story about their lives, their work, and their values.

Of course, I want STELLAE to be more than just a collection of old recipes. My long-term vision is to build a educational resource. A place where you can not only discover recipes but also learn about the historical context surrounding them.

Food history is human history. It's about economics, culture, and how we've interacted with the world around us.  STELLAE is my way of sharing that passion and making this history accessible to everyone.
