title: Monetization

Maintaining a clean, uncluttered website is a priority. Traditional online advertising, with its intrusive banners and pop-ups, simply wouldn't be a good fit for STELLAE. It detracts from the user experience and, frankly, feels out of place amongst historical recipes.

I'm exploring alternative approaches to monetization. One idea is to delve into video content. Whether thats the  recipes themselves, mini documentaries, or just shorts. 

Another option is subtly integrating product links within the recipes themselves. Imagine clicking on "dried plums" in a Victorian plum pudding recipe and being directed to a purveyor of high-quality dried fruits. This approach allows for relevant, unobtrusive partnerships that enhance the user experience rather than disrupt it.
