1 Can	[[Beer]] (Room Temp)

### Instructions
1. Preheat Oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Prepare Pan: Grease or line a muffin tin (makes approximately 24 mini muffins, or fewer larger ones).
3. Combine Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the biscuit mix, sugar and the room-temperature beer. Stir until just combined. Do not overmix. The batter will be slightly lumpy, do not worry.
4. Fill Muffin Tins: Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full.
5. Bake: Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 
6. Cool: Let the biscuits cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely (or serve warm).
