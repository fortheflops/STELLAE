### Instructions
1. **Preheat and Prepare:** Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease and flour a loaf pan (likely a standard 9x5 inch loaf pan).
2. **Prepare Orange:** Grate the rind of the orange and set aside. Juice the orange and set aside separately.
3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients:** Melt the shortening. Combine the melted shortening with enough boiling water to measure 1/2 cup of liquid total. Do not include the orange juice in this measurement.
4. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and chopped nuts.
5. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, combine the beaten egg, orange rind, orange juice, and the melted shortening/boiling water mixture.
6. **Add Wet to Dry:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not overmix.
7. **Fold in Cranberries:** Gently fold in the chopped cranberries.
8. **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 1 hour, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. **Cool:** Let the bread cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.
