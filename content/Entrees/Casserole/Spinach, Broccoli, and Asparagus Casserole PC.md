### Instructions
1. **Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).** Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. **Thaw and drain the frozen vegetables.** Squeeze out as much excess moisture as possible. This will prevent the casserole from being watery.
3. **Combine ingredients:** In a large bowl, mix together the thawed vegetables, sour cream, and cottage cheese.
4. **Add Bisquick:** Gradually add Bisquick to the vegetable mixture, starting with 1/2 cup. Mix until just combined. You may need to add more Bisquick to reach a thicker consistency, but don't add too much or the casserole will be dry. Aim for a consistency that holds its shape but is still moist.
5. **Assemble casserole:** Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
6. **Top with tomato and cheese:** Arrange the sliced tomatoes over the top of the casserole. Sprinkle generously with grated Parmesan cheese.
7. **Bake:** Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the casserole is heated through, the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is lightly browned.
8. **Let cool:** Let the casserole cool for 10-15 minutes before serving. This will allow it to set slightly.
