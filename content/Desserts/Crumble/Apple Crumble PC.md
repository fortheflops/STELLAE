### Instructions
1. Grease a pan.
2. Slice the Apples into the pan.
3. Sprinkle with 1 Tbsp Flour, Cinnamon, and Sugar.
4. Make the "crumbling" topping: Combine the ½ cup Rolled Oats, ½ cup Brown Sugar, ¼ cup Flour, and 4 Tbsp Butter. The instruction "Mix Crumbling Mix" suggests that these ingredients should be mixed until they form a crumbly texture, likely by cutting in the butter with a pastry blender or your fingers.
5. Put the topping on top of the apples.
6. Bake at 300-325°F for 1 hour.
7. Test the apples for doneness. (Likely, they should be tender when pierced with a fork or knife).
8. Best served warm.
