### Instructions
 Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C).
1. In a large bowl, beat the eggs.
2. Add the Karo syrup, sugar, and flour to the eggs. Mix well until combined.
3. Stir in the pecans, vanilla (about 1 teaspoon is a good starting point), cream, and melted butter.
4. Pour the mixture into an unbaked 9-inch [[content/Desserts/Pie/Crust/index|Pie Crust]].
5. Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the center is set. The pie may still jiggle slightly in the center but should not be liquid.  
6. Let cool completely before serving.
