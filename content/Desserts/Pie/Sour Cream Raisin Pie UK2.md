### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Filling:** In a saucepan, combine the sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, raisins, and sour cream.
2. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.
3. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks with a fork.
4. Gradually whisk a small amount of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks to temper them.
5. Pour the tempered egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the filling.
6. Add the butter and continue to cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the butter is melted and the filling is smooth.

7. **Assemble and Bake the Pie:**
    * Pour the hot filling into a pre-baked 9-inch pie shell.
    * Prepare a meringue topping using egg whites (reserved from separating the yolks earlier) and sugar, if desired.
    * Spread the meringue over the hot filling, sealing the edges to the crust.
    * Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 12-15 minutes, or until the meringue is golden brown.
8. Let cool before serving.
