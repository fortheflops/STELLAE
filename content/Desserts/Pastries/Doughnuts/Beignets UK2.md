### Instructions
1. **Make the Dough:** In a heavy-bottomed pot, combine the butter, water, and sugar. Bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat.
2. **Add Flour:** Remove from heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or heat-resistant spatula until the mixture forms a smooth ball that pulls away from the sides of the pot.
3. **Cool Slightly:** Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) and let it cool slightly for about 5-10 minutes. This prevents the eggs from scrambling when added.
4. **Incorporate Eggs:** Add the eggs and egg yolk one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. The dough will appear to separate at first, but keep beating until it comes back together into a smooth, glossy paste. A stand mixer with a paddle attachment is very helpful here, but it can be done by hand.
5. **Heat Oil:** In a deep fryer or a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil or shortening to 375°F (190°C). Use a deep-fry thermometer for accuracy.
6. **Fry the Beignets:** Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons (about the size of an egg, as indicated in the original recipe, gives a good size reference) into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pot; fry in batches.
7. **Fry Until Golden Brown:** Fry the beignets for about 2-3 minutes per side, turning them as needed, until they are puffed up and golden brown.
8. **Drain and Dust:** Remove the beignets with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
9. **Dusting.** Immediately dust generously with confectioners' sugar while still warm.
10. **Serve:** Serve warm. Beignets are best enjoyed fresh.
