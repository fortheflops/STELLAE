### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Cake Batter:**
    * In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
    * Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, then stir in the ribbon cane syrup.
    * In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice.
    * Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.
    * Stir in the raisins, nuts, chopped apples, coconut, and crushed pineapple.

2. **Bake the Cake:**
    * Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    * Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.
    * Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.
    * Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
    * Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely.

3. **Prepare the Filling:**
    * In a saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar, 1 cup milk, and a piece of butter the size of an egg.
    * Add 1 cup nuts, 1 cup dates, 1 cup coconut, and ½ cup drained crushed pineapple.
    * Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens to a spreading consistency.
4. **Assemble the Cake:**
    * Once the cakes are completely cool, spread the filling between the layers and on top of the cake.
