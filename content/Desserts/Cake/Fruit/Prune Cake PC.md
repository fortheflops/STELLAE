### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Prunes:** After washing, cook the prunes until they are soft. This might involve simmering them in water or in the boiling coffee. Once cooked, remove the pits and chop or mash the prunes.
2. **Cream Together:** In a large bowl, cream together the Shortening and Sugar until light and fluffy.
3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the Flour, Salt, Mace, Cinnamon, and Soda.
4. **Beat in Eggs:** Separate the egg yolks and whites, beat the yolks. Then, beat the yolks into the creamed mixture one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
5. **Add Wet Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the boiling coffee, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.
6. **Incorporate Prunes:** Gently stir in the prepared prunes.
7. **Whip Egg Whites:** In a clean bowl, beat the Egg Whites until stiff peaks form.
8. **Fold in Egg Whites:** Gently fold the stiffened Egg Whites into the batter in two or three additions, being careful not to deflate the whites.
9. **Bake:** Pour the batter into a greased and floured cake pan (size not specified, but likely a 9x13 inch pan or tube pan).
10. Bake in a moderate oven (likely around 350°F) until the cake "leaves the pan" (meaning the edges start to pull away) or a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Baking time is not specified but could be around 45-60 minutes or longer, depending on the pan size.
