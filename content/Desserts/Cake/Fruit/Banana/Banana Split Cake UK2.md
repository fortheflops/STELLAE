### Instructions
1. **Preheat and Prepare Pan:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan, or line with parchment paper for easier removal.
2. **Combine Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, and oleo (or softened butter). Mix with your hands or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. If desired, add chopped nuts and mix well.
3. **Press into Pan:** Press the mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
4. **Bake:** Bake for 20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden brown.
5. **Cool:** Let the crust cool completely before adding the filling.
6. **Beat Filling Mixture:** In a large bowl, beat together the confectioners sugar, well-beaten eggs, softened oleo (or butter), vanilla extract, and butter flavoring. Beat for 5 minutes with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
7. **Spread Over Crust:** Spread the filling mixture evenly over the cooled crust.
8. **Layer Bananas:** Arrange the sliced bananas evenly over the filling, covering the entire surface.
9. **Layer Pineapple:** Drain the crushed pineapple very well, pressing out any excess liquid. Spread the drained pineapple evenly over the bananas.
10. **Top with Cool Whip:** Spread the thawed Cool Whip evenly over the pineapple layer.
11. **Garnish (Optional):** If desired, garnish the top with maraschino cherries and chopped nuts.
12. **Chill:** Refrigerate the cake for at least 2-3 hours before serving to allow the layers to set. This dessert is even better if made a day in advance, allowing the flavors to meld.
