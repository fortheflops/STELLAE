### Instructions
#### Cake
1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Grease and flour an angel food cake pan.
3. Sprinkle chopped Pecans or Walnuts on top of the flour in the prepared pan.
4. Beat Cake Mix, Pudding, Eggs, ½ cup Rum, Oil, and Cold Water as per directions on the cake mix box.
5. If baking in Albuquerque, follow high-altitude directions (add Flour, lower the heat, and reduce baking time).
6. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
7. Bake. (Baking time is not specified in the email but is implied to be less than an hour. Use the toothpick test to check for doneness.)
8. Let cool slightly before turning it out of the pan.
9. Use a toothpick to poke lots of holes in the top of the cake to allow the glaze to soak in.

#### Glaze:
1. Combine ¼ cup Water, Butter, and Sugar in a saucepan.
2. Cook together and stir constantly.
3. Remove from heat and add ½ cup Rum.
4. Brush or pour the glaze over the still-warm cake.
