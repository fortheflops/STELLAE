>[!Quote] Recipe Notes (From 1997 Attempt)
>- **Vinegar:** Used 1 1/2 quarts of vinegar.
>- **Water:** Did not use quite as much water because the pot was too full. Next time use the right amount.
>- **Ingredient Reduction:** Reduced ingredients slightly to ensure there was enough liquid to cover the chow chow in the jars.
>- **Sweetness:** The final product was a little sweet.
