### Instructions
1. **Prepare Ingredients:** Wash the cranberries and oranges thoroughly. It's a good practice, unwritten on this recipie, to use the zest and juice of the oranges, and remove their piths. _Optionally_, give all ingredients a rough chop before grinding to make the food processor/chopper's job easier. Add a splash of lemon juice (to taste; start with 1-2 tablespoons). The lemon juice adds brightness and helps preserve the color.
2. **Grind:** Grind all ingredients together in a food chopper or food processor until desired consistency is reached. You can make it a coarse relish or a finer, almost sauce-like consistency, depending on your preference.
3. **Chill:** Transfer the relish to a container, cover, and chill for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld. This also helps the relish thicken slightly.
4. **Serve:** Serve cold as a condiment with poultry, pork, or other dishes.
