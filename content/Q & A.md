## Old recipe collections usually contain newspaper/blog clippings. Why are they not included here? 

We're very careful about respecting copyright laws. Newspaper clippings and blog posts are often protected by copyright, which means we can't share them without permission. We focus on recipes from old cookbooks and family collections because they are less likely to have copyright issues. We want to make sure we're sharing recipes legally and ethically. 

*That said, we might be able to include them if we were to recreate the recipe in video formatâ€”more on that later*
