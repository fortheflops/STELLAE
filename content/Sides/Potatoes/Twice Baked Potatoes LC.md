>"(I like my potatoes with a little "tooth" so I didn't add as much milk as the recipe called for.) I didn't like the bacon in the potatoes—but then I don't put bacon on a potato."
>
>"Since the chives were so expensive ($1.00 for the little bunch), I froze the rest. Should be OK to use them in the same potato recipe—just thaw them out first"
