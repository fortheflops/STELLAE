### Instructions
1. **Combine dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, salt, red pepper, and baking powder.
2. **Add wet ingredients:** Add the chopped onion and egg to the dry ingredients.
3. **Add milk:** Gradually stir in sweet milk until the batter will almost drip from a spoon. The consistency should be thinner than cornbread batter but not watery.
4. **Heat oil:** In a deep fryer or large, heavy pot, heat about 2-3 inches of oil to 350°F (175°C). You can use a deep-fry thermometer to check the temperature, or test by dropping a small amount of batter into the oil. It should sizzle and float to the surface.
5. **Fry hush puppies:** Carefully drop rounded tablespoons of batter into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pot.
6. **Cook until golden brown:** Fry for 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally, until the hush puppies are golden brown and cooked through.
7. **Drain:** Remove the cooked hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
8. **Serve:** Serve hot, optionally with tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, or your favorite dipping sauce.
